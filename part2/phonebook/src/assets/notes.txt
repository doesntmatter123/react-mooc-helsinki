The current problem:
- If there is a present filter, (isFilterActive === true), then 'filteredPersons' is displayed in the <Persons> component
- when adding a new person into 'persons' using setPersons, the 'persons' is thefore updated, but since the <Persons> component keeps displaying
the non-updated 'filteredPersons' state, neither the new 'persons' state nor the 'filteredPersons' is displayed

FIX:
-
